## Scala Commons GitHub Pages

### Jekyll Theme

The site is built using the [jekyll-theme-cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) theme.

### Previewing the site locally

If you'd like to preview the site locally (for example, in the process of proposing a change):

1. Clone down the site's repository (`git clone https://github.com/scommons/scommons.github.io`)
2. `cd` into the site's directory
3. Run `./script/bootstrap.sh` to install the necessary dependencies
4. Run `./script/server.sh` to start the preview server
5. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to preview the site

### Running tests

The site contains a minimal test suite, to ensure a site with the theme would build successfully.
To run the tests, simply run `./script/cibuild.sh`.
You'll need to run `./script/bootstrap.sh` one before the test script will work.
